SciMark2 Numeric Benchmark, see http://math.nist.gov/scimark

This is a C# port of the Java code (Port done by: https://github.com/sushihangover/scimark-csharp). I added JSON output only and added more commandline options, I also refactored some of it.

This is the C# port of the Scimark benchmark. The original C and Java sources can be found at http://math.nist.gov/scimark2/. The original work to port the benchmark to C# was done by Chris Re and Wener Vogels of the Rotor project.

The Rotor project's page has gone offline, so this project was started to prevent the sources from being lost to history.
